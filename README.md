Real fans of cheese say that there are as many sorts of cheese as days in a year. You will take the whole year to taste all 
of them if you eat one a day. It’s no secret that the French are big fans of cheese. In a year, they eat 25 kilos per person. Moreover,
they are famous by making all the variety of cheese. For example, Normandy Camembert is a symbol of France, and it can’t be produced anywhere.
You can buy cheese called Camembert only in France; others are only its pale copies.
Cheese can’t be relocated in another country or even in another region, not even in a neighbouring village. It means that cheese with
a protected designation belong to a geographical area and to the people who occupy it. It is a kind of guarantee for the well-being of cows and goats.
For example, Roquefort dates back at least to the 11th century. The milk collected for Roquefort is delineated in a territory of 100 kilometres around the 
village of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon. Moreover, refining can only be done in the municipality of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon.
Connoisseurs of cheese have their own preferences. They would choose cheese which is not well sold, but which is bought for taste reasons. They don’t think of the size of their wallet in those moments
. The composition of the cheese plate varies enormously according to the tastes. The following sorts of cheese could appear on their typical cheese plate. There would be a Camembert from Normandy,
a piece of Comté, Emmental cheese, Roquefort and Munster cheese.
